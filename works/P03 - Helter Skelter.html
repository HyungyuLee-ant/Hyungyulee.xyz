                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Helter Skelter is a word that is used to describe a spiral slide in carnival. Riding helter skelter is like falling down
                inifinitely, while revolving around the center.</p>
                <p>After reading the novel A Horse Walks into a Bar by David Grossman, we thought that COVID patients, whose daily activity
                is released to and scrutinized by the public, was like Dovaleh, who suffered from Stigma. After reading I Got Covid by
                Jiho Kim, an essay written by COVID-19 patient who spent about 50 days in hospital cell, and suffered from people’s
                opinion about him in company / social life.</p>
                <p>So we created a pencil drawing-based animation that resembled a scrawl journal of Dovaleh of our times. Main visual
                formats are sketch animation like reading through a patient’s diary, and some news clips, graphic effects replicating
                the comments (which are excerpts from actual comments in the web) and narration is used.</p>
                <p>Working as a duo, both not living in Seoul, and COVID outburst in our neighborhood made us try making a film without
                meeting physically.</p>
                <p>In the end, with no support from others, Dovaleh gives up talking and gets off the stage. Many Dovalehs would have given
                up communicating with others like him up until now. Thus, there would be less place for people to communicate.</p>
                <p>Helter Skelter was screened at the Virtual Visual Story Showcase, which took place at October 2020.</p>
